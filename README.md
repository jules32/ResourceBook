# How does it work?

This online book is being built automatically with a GitHub Action. The Action is not loading R (or Python), so any code you will not render and in fact will cause the GitHub Action to fail. Note, for plain markdown, you can use `.md` instead of `.qmd`.

The structure of the book is in `_quarto.yml`. The rest should be self-explanatory after you look at that file.
