## Licenses

Work of the United States government that is done by US federal employees as part of their official duties is generally [in the public domain](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/#us_government_works) within the United States of America. That means it cannot be copyrighted. (The relevant law is [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105) Code (or anything else) developed by US federal employees should have a notice that the work is in the public domain. It is common to waive copyright and related rights in the work worldwide through the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication.

Government agencies will use some kind of public domain license, but which one used varies. There are two main licenses used for products by federal agencies (or their employees) on GitHub: Creative Commons license (CC0-1.0) and the GNU General Public License v3. [CC0-1.0 is a very broad declaration of public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) while [GPL-3 is explicit about derivative works and how those works must retain an open source license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

<!--
* The [NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/) recommends [GPL-3](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources/blob/master/LICENSE) over CC0-1.0 since the latter is not designed specifically for software. An [additional note](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources/blob/master/LICENSE.md) is added to clarify that the material is a US Government work. See their [Resources](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources) repository.
-->
* Other [NOAA Affiliated GitHub organizations](https://github.com/NOAAGov/NOAA-Affiliated-Projects) use a mix of GPL-3 and CC0-1.0.
* USGS uses [CC0-1.0 License + additional info](https://github.com/usgs/best-practices/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
* EPA seems to use CC0-1.0 License, e.g. [useeior](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior)
* CISA also seems to use CC0-1.0 License, e.g. [Sparrow](https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow#license)
* Dept of Labor also uses CC0-1.0 License + additional info, e.g. [ableist language app](https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/ableist-language-detector/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
* NASA uses [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee/blob/master/LICENSE) mostly
* GSA uses [CC0-1.0 License](https://github.com/18F/fedramp-data#public-domain)
* I (Eli Holmes) use [CC0-1.0](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/MARSS/blob/master/License.md) with a note at the top that the work is a US federal government work by US federal employees as part of their official duties.

## Additional License information

In addition to one of the standard licenses above we also add the following addendum:

```
Software code created by U.S. Government employees is not subject to
copyright in the United States (17 U.S.C. ยง105). The United State
s/Department of Commerce reserve all rights to seek and obtain copyright
protection in countries other than the United States for Software authored
in its entirety by the Department of Commerce. To this end, the Department
of Commerce hereby grants to Recipient a royalty-free, nonexclusive license
to use, copy, and create derivative works of the Software outside of the
United States.
```

## Specifying the license for an R package

* At the base level of your package, add a `LICENSE` text file. See for example, [US government work + CC0-1.0](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/MARSS/blob/master/License.md).
* Then in your `DESCRIPTION` file, put the line
```
License: file LICENSE
```
* What is in that `LICENSE` file? If you are using a standard license, like GPL-2 or GPL-3, then you put that license in the file. Search the internet for the text. But CRAN might complain if you do that and are submitting to CRAN. In that case, you could just do
```
License: GPL-2
```


## Disclaimers

Besides the license, code from federal agencies should also have a disclaimer that the code is 'as is' and the user assumes responsibility for its use. 

* The Fisheries Integrated Toolbox has a [Disclaimer](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources/blob/master/Disclaimer.md) for US Government products in its [Resources](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources) repo.
* The repos on the EPA organization use a few different (albeit similar) disclaimers. [Generic](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ#epa-disclaimer),  [GitHub specific](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior#disclaimer).
* [CISA repos](https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow#legal-disclaimer) have a bit of an ad hoc disclaimer.

Here is a standard disclaimer. Here tailored for a repository on GitHub.

```
