## Licenses

Work of the United States government that is done by US federal employees as part of their official duties is generally [in the public domain](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/#us_government_works) within the United States of America. That means it cannot be copyrighted. (The relevant law is [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105) Code (or anything else) developed by US federal employees should have a notice that the work is in the public domain. It is common to waive copyright and related rights in the work worldwide through the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication.

Government agencies will use some kind of public domain license, but which one used varies. There are two main licenses used for products by federal agencies (or their employees) on GitHub: Creative Commons license (CC0-1.0) and the GNU General Public License v3. [CC0-1.0 is a very broad declaration of public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) while [GPL-3 is explicit about derivative works and how those works must retain an open source license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

* Other [NOAA Affiliated GitHub organizations](https://github.com/NOAAGov/NOAA-Affiliated-Projects) use a mix of GPL-3 and CC0-1.0.
* USGS uses [CC0-1.0 License + additional info](https://github.com/usgs/best-practices/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
* EPA seems to use CC0-1.0 License, e.g. [useeior](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior)
* CISA also seems to use CC0-1.0 License, e.g. [Sparrow](https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow#license)
* Dept of Labor also uses CC0-1.0 License + additional info, e.g. [ableist language app](https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/ableist-language-detector/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
* NASA uses [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee/blob/master/LICENSE) mostly
* GSA uses [CC0-1.0 License](https://github.com/18F/fedramp-data#public-domain)

There are some special considerations for licenses for open source software. The CC0 website [does not recommend the license for software](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-software), but instead recommends using an open source license designed for software. If you want to publish your tool in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/), for example, CC0 is not acceptable because it is not one of the [listed open source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/) on the Open Source Initiative.


## Additional License information

In addition to one of the standard licenses above we also add the following addendum:

```
Software code created by U.S. Government employees is not subject to
copyright in the United States (17 U.S.C. ยง105). The United State
s/Department of Commerce reserve all rights to seek and obtain copyright
protection in countries other than the United States for Software authored
in its entirety by the Department of Commerce. To this end, the Department
of Commerce hereby grants to Recipient a royalty-free, nonexclusive license
to use, copy, and create derivative works of the Software outside of the
United States.
```

## Specifying the license for an R package

* At the base level of your package, add a `LICENSE` text file which will list the license plus the addendum above. For example, here is an example of the LICENSE file for the [MARSS package](https://github.com/atsa-es/MARSS).

```
The MARSS package as a whole is distributed under GPL-3 (GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE version 3).

In addition this software has the following license addendum:

Software code created by U.S. Government employees is not subject to
copyright in the United States (17 U.S.C. ยง105). The United State
s/Department of Commerce reserve all rights to seek and obtain copyright
protection in countries other than the United States for Software authored
in its entirety by the Department of Commerce. To this end, the Department
of Commerce hereby grants to Recipient a royalty-free, nonexclusive license
to use, copy, and create derivative works of the Software outside of the
United States.
```

* Then in your `DESCRIPTION` file, put the line
```
License: GPL-3 | file LICENSE
```
Replace "GPL-3" with the license you are using.

## Disclaimers

Besides the license, code from federal agencies should also have a disclaimer that the code is 'as is' and the user assumes responsibility for its use. 

* The Fisheries Integrated Toolbox has a [Disclaimer](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources/blob/master/Disclaimer.md) for US Government products in its [Resources](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources) repo.
* The repos on the EPA organization use a few different (albeit similar) disclaimers. [Generic](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ#epa-disclaimer),  [GitHub specific](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior#disclaimer).
* [CISA repos](https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow#legal-disclaimer) have a bit of an ad hoc disclaimer.

Here is a standard disclaimer. Here tailored for a repository on GitHub.

```
This repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce. All NOAA GitHub project code is provided on an 'as is' basis and the user assumes responsibility for its use. Any claims against the Department of Commerce or Department of Commerce bureaus stemming from the use of this GitHub project will be governed by all applicable Federal law. Any reference to specific commercial products, processes, or services by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply their endorsement, recommendation or favoring by the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce seal and logo, or the seal and logo of a DOC bureau, shall not be used in any manner to imply endorsement of any commercial product or activity by DOC or the United States Government.
